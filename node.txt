transition


Transpilation-process of converting one version of js to other(ES5).
(Babel-F/W used for converting one js version to another)

Developed code is different from deployed code

Bundling -- Bundling tool walks through to the code from an entry point ...It utilizes a transpiler(babel)
converts the code to target version(ES5)....it walk multiple js files (source) and libraries link only neccessary
 code and skips the code that is never part of your project...
 it converts css specification in js code..all files are bundled into a single file(sum times two or more)...
 bundles also minifies your code and removes unit test code..any code which configure to be skipped.
 
 grunt,gulp-- were the task running frameworks and libraries where we do this task.
 
 webpack--automates this undling task with no code only configuration.(angular uses internally)...
 
 

Production

html + (minified js without unneccessaary code)
